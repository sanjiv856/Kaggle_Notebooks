# Prepare  

**Guiding questions**:  

**Where is your data located? How is the data organized?**  
**_Data Location and Organization_**: The data can be accessed from Divvy bicycle through this [LINK](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). It represents the historical trip data of Cyclistic bikes and is organized into separate CSV files, each covering a month's worth of rides. The data includes details such as trip duration, start and end times, station information, bike type, and user type (casual or annual member).

**Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC (reliable, original, comprehensive, current and cited)?**  
**_Data Bias and Credibility_**: While the data is provided by the bike-sharing service company itself, it's important to recognize potential biases that may arise from operational constraints or data collection methods. However, it meets the criteria of ROCCC (reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited) and is considered credible for analysis.

**How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?**  
**_Licensing, Privacy, Security, and Accessibility_**: The data is subjected to the license provided [HERE](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data is made available under a specific license that permits its use for analysis. It preserves privacy by excluding personally identifiable information and is stored securely.

**How did you verify the data’s integrity?**  
**_Data Integrity_**: The integrity of the data will be verified through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify and address any inconsistencies (i.e., missing values, outliers, or duplicate entries). The files exhibit consistent columns and data types across different time periods.

**_Data Relevance to the Business Question_**: The dataset provides valuable insights into the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by both casual riders and annual members, directly addressing the business question of understanding user behavior differences. Analysis of the data will inform the development of a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.  

**_Potential Problems_**: Potential issues with the data may include missing or erroneous entries, as well as bias introduced by the sampling method. Additionally, the dataset might lack certain information, such as demographic details of riders, which could be useful for analysis. Updating information about bike stations and gathering more details about riders could enhance the analysis.

**Key tasks**  

**_Download the data and store it appropriately_**: Initially, the data was stored locally for RMarkdown creation and later uploaded to Kaggle before running and publishing the final notebook.

**_Identify how the data organized_**: The data is structured into CSV files. CSV files (12 files) from last one year (2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31) were downloaded into the data folder and merged into one single file. First six rows of the data used for the analysis is shown in the table\ \@ref(tab:table1). Verify whether the columns are correctly interpreted for their data type. Utilize the `str()` function for this purpose. If the data is not recognized in the correct format, convert it using functions such as `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.Date()`, etc.    

```{r data_cleaning, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
merged_files = 
  list.files(path = "/kaggle/input/cyclistic-2023/Cyclistic_2023", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>%
  lapply(read_csv) %>%
  bind_rows
```

```{r table1, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', out.width="100%"}

merged_files %>% 
  head() %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  flextable::set_caption("First six rows of the data.") %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) %>%
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align_text_col(align = "center") %>% 
  align_nottext_col(align = "center")  
```
**_Sort and filter the data_**: Explore the dataset to grasp its structure and the meaning of each column. The table\ \@ref(tab:table2) contains a description of the dataset columns. Updated missing data for `start_station_name`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_name`, and `end_station_id` to be labeled as "unknown". Filtering involves removing data where the start time exceeds the end time and eliminating rows with missing values using `drop_na()`. Dropping rows with missing values isn't always advisable; there are alternative methods for handling them. Given the abundance of data in terms of row count, we're opting to simplify here by removing them in this instance. No duplicates were identified using `filtered_data_1 %>% group_by(ride_id) %>% filter(n()>1)` on the `ride_id` column. In case duplicates are present in the data, they can be removed using `filtered_data_1 = filtered_data_1[!duplicated(filtered_data_1$ride_id), ]`.  

```{r table2, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', out.width="100%"}

data.frame(Column = colnames(merged_files), 
           Details = c("Unique IDs for every ride", 
                       "Type of bike, electric, classic or docked", 
                       "Started ride time", "Ended ride time", 
                       "Name of ride starting station", 
                       "ID of starting station",
                       "Name of ride ending station", 
                       "ID of ending station", 
                       "Starting latitude", "Starting longitude",
                       "Ending latitude", "Ending longitude",
                       "Membership type")) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  flextable::set_caption("Description of columns in the dataset") %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) %>%
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align_text_col(align = "left") %>% 
  align_nottext_col(align = "center")  
```

```{r , eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', out.width="100%"}
filtered_data_1 =
  merged_files %>% 
  filter(ended_at > started_at) %>% # removing rows where start time exceeds the end time
  mutate(start_station_name = 
           ifelse(is.na(start_station_name), 'unknown', start_station_name), 
         start_station_id = 
           ifelse(is.na(start_station_id), 'unknown', start_station_id), 
         end_station_name = 
           ifelse(is.na(end_station_name), 'unknown', end_station_name), 
         end_station_id = 
           ifelse(is.na(end_station_id), 'unknown', end_station_id)) %>% 
  drop_na() # removing other rows with missing data
```

**_Determine the credibility of the data_**: The data provided for this work comes from a reputable source, ensuring its credibility. However, it's essential to consider other factors like ROCCC (reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited) when assessing data credibility.  

**Deliverable**  

**_A description of all data sources used_**: The main data source consists of riding data spanning 12 months, from January to December 2023, provided by Cyclistic company. Filtering has been applied to remove duplicates, rows with missing data, and instances where the start time exceeds the end time.       

# Process   

**Guiding questions**:  

**What tools are you choosing and why?**
**_Tools_**: I choose `R`, `RMarkdown`, and multiple libraries such as `tidyverse`, and `flextable` for data analysis. R provides a comprehensive environment for statistical computing and graphics, while RMarkdown allows for seamless integration of code, results, and narrative in a single document. The tidyverse package offers a suite of tools for data manipulation and visualization, streamlining the analysis process. Additionally, flextable provides flexibility in creating and formatting tables, enhancing the presentation of analytical results. These tools collectively enable efficient and reproducible data analysis workflows.   

**Have you ensured your data’s integrity?**
**_Data integrity_**: This is dealt with before in the previous sections **_Determine the credibility of the data_** and **_Data Bias and Credibility_**.  

**What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?**
**_Data Cleaning_**: To ensure that the data is clean, several steps were taken as outlined in the section **_Sort and filter the data_**. Firstly, the `str()` function was used to verify if the data types in the columns are read correctly. Additionally, adjustments were made to the data by adding new columns based on calculations of existing columns. These new columns were designed to facilitate the analysis and derive more insightful conclusions. For example, new columns were added to calculate time differences between rides, determine the day of the week, hour, month, and year of each ride, as well as calculated distances. These steps contribute to enhancing the quality and usability of the dataset for the analysis.

**How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?**
Data is clean was ensured for analysis by visualizing missing data both before and after removing NAs (See Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataCleanVerify)). Detailed information can be found in the **_Data Cleaning_** and **_Sort and Filter Data_** sections. 

```{r dataCleanVerify, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.width = 16, fig.height = 6, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of missing values before and after NA removal. **A**. Before removing NA, **B**. After removing NA"}

# Before cleaning
a = gg_miss_var(merged_files, show_pct = TRUE) +
  theme_classic() +
  # scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "white"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "white"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.line = element_line(size = 0.7, color = "black"),
        text = element_text(size = 24), 
        axis.text = element_text(angle=0, vjust=0.5, size=18, face = "bold"), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",
                                        size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), 
        axis.ticks = element_line(size = 0.5, colour = "black"), 
        legend.position = c(0.8, 1.0),
        legend.text = element_text(size=rel(0.8))) 

# After cleaning 
b = gg_miss_var(filtered_data_1, show_pct = TRUE) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "white"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "white"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.line = element_line(size = 0.7, color = "black"),
        text = element_text(size = 24), 
        axis.text = element_text(angle=0, vjust=0.5, size=18, face = "bold"), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",
                                        size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), 
        axis.ticks = element_line(size = 0.5, colour = "black"), 
        legend.position = c(0.8, 1.0),
        legend.text = element_text(size=rel(0.8))) 

cowplot::plot_grid(a, b, ncol = 2, align = "h")
```

**Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?**
**_Data Cleaning Steps_**:   

1. Verified data types using `str()`.  
2. Updated missing data for `start_station_name`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_name`, and `end_station_id` to be labeled as `unknown`  
3. Eliminated rows with missing values using `drop_na()`.  
4. Filtered out rows where the end time is before the start time using `filter(ended_at > started_at)`.  
5. Introduced new columns to:
 + Compute time differences between rides.  
 + Identify the weekday, hour, month, and year for each ride.  
 + Calculate distances.  
6. Filtered rows with trip duration greater than 24 hours
7. Three rows with `end_lat` and `end_lng` as 0 were removed. 
8. since most of the trip duration are less than 100 minutes, rows with trip duration greater than 100 minutes were removed (< 0.86% of the data)
9. Code used:  

```{r , eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', out.width="100%", fig.cap=""}

# Adding new columns

filtered_data_2 =
  filtered_data_1 %>% 
  mutate(trip_duration_difftime = difftime(filtered_data_1$ended_at, filtered_data_1$started_at, 
                                           units = "mins"), 
         starting_hour = strftime(filtered_data_1$ended_at, "%H"), # starting hour
         weekday = strftime(filtered_data_1$ended_at, "%a"), # weekday
         month = strftime(filtered_data_1$ended_at, "%b"), # month
         day_of_month = strftime(filtered_data_1$ended_at, "%d")) %>% # day of the month  
  filter(trip_duration_difftime <= 100) %>% #removed trips > 100 minutes 
  filter(end_lat > 40, end_lng < -85) # removed end_lat & end_lng as 0
```
10. Newly created variables were tested for integrity by plotting (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataCleanVerify1)).  

```{r dataCleanVerify1, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.width = 16, fig.height = 16, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of missing values before and after NA removal. **A**. Distribution of trip_duration, **B**. Distribution of startng_hour, **C**. Distribution of weekday, **D**. Distribution of day_of_month, **E**. Distribution of month, **F**. Percent distribution of Casual users and Members"}

# Analyze  

**Guiding questions**

**_How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it? Has your data been properly formatted?_** To perform analysis on the data, it is important to organize it in a structured and accessible manner. This involves formatting the data appropriately, ensuring consistency across variables, and creating a unified view of the dataset. In this case, the data has been organized into a single CSV file by concatenating all the files from the dataset. Additionally, all columns have been assigned their correct data types, indicating that the data has been properly formatted. Therefore, the data is organized effectively and has been checked to ensure that each column has the proper data type. Any inconsistencies were addressed through appropriate data formatting techniques.

**_What surprises did you discover in the data?_**
During the descriptive analysis, several surprises emerged from the data, shedding light on unexpected patterns and trends. One notable finding was the distinct differences observed between members and casual riders when analyzing weekday usage. There was a positive correlation (Figure\ \@ref(fig:correlation1)) between the _member_casual_ and weekday, which requires further analysis of categorizing weekday data into weekday and weekend to understand the difference between _members_ and _casual riders_. There was also negative correlation between _member_casual_ and _rideable_type_ indicating differences in the preferences between these two groups. Additionally, contrary to expectations, it was surprising to discover that members exhibit less riding time compared to casual riders. These unexpected insights highlight the importance of thorough data analysis in uncovering valuable information that may not be initially apparent.

**_What trends or relationships did you find in the data?_**
Several trends and relationships within the data were identified. Firstly, members tend to take more rides for a longer trip duration compared to casual bike riders. Additionally, the number of rides by members is higher throughout most hours of the day compared to casual riders, with minimal differences during off-peak hours, potentially due to limited availability of other modes of public transport. On weekends, especially Saturdays, there is a higher number of casual riders compared to the rest of the week. Trends for both member types remain consistent across any day of the month and throughout the year. The dataset contains more members compared to casual riders. Despite being relatively low, membership type exhibits the highest positive correlation with the weekday and the highest negative correlation with the type of bike, indicating some preferential differences between member types that warrant further investigation. Lastly, the persona of the casual rider appears to be more spontaneous, as evidenced by off-peak usage of bikes and increased usage on weekends compared to more regular members, suggesting they may be tourists or individuals seeking leisure activities.

**_How will these insights help answer your business questions?_**
These insights will significantly contribute to answering our main business question regarding how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. By understanding the distinct trends and behaviors between these two user groups, we can tailor our marketing strategies, service offerings, and operational decisions to better meet their needs. For example, knowing that members tend to take longer rides and utilize bikes more consistently throughout the day can help us optimize bike availability and station placements. Additionally, recognizing the higher demand for casual riders on weekends can guide promotional efforts and pricing strategies aimed at attracting this segment during peak times. Overall, these insights provide valuable guidance for enhancing customer satisfaction, increasing ridership, and maximizing the overall success of Cyclistic.

**Key tasks**   

**Aggregate your data for usability and accessibility.** The data has been aggregated, organized, and formatted according to the procedures outlined in the previous sections titled **_Data Cleaning_** and **_Organize and format your data_**. A summary of the aggregated data is provided in tables (Tables \@ref(tab:summaryTable1) to \@ref(tab:summaryTable4)).

**Organize and format your data.** In the Data Cleaning Steps section, various cleaning and organization steps were described. Specifically, the columns _rideable_type, start_station_id, end_station_id, member_casual, starting_hour, weekday, month, and day_of_month_ were selected to create the correlation matrix (Figure\ \@ref(fig:correlation1)).

**Perform calculations.** Several plots were generated to gain insights into the data (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataAnalysis1)). Plots were created for _rideable_type, start_station_id, end_station_id, starting_hour, weekday, month, and day_of_month_, plotting membership type _member_casual_.

**_Identify trends and relationships._**   

Numerous patterns and connections within the data were uncovered, as outlined below:

1. Generally, the number of rides for member trip duration exceeds those of casual bike riders (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataAnalysis1)A).

2. Members tend to ride more frequently throughout most hours of the day compared to casual riders. However, during off-peak hours (between 02:00 and 04:00), the disparity is minimal, possibly due to limited availability of alternative modes of transportation, prompting more casual riders to utilize bikes (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataAnalysis1)B and table\ \@ref(tab:summaryTable1)).

```{r summaryTable1, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.width = 16, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%"}

filtered_data_2 %>% 
  group_by(starting_hour) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = length(ride_id), 
            avg_ride_duration = mean(trip_duration_difftime), 
            percentage = number_of_rides/nrow(filtered_data_2) * 100, 
            member_pct = (sum(member_casual == "member") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            casual_pct = (sum(member_casual == "casual") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            member_casual_pct_diff = member_pct - casual_pct) %>% 
  arrange(starting_hour) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  flextable::set_caption("Summary data for hour of the day (starting_hour).") %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) %>%
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align_text_col(align = "center") %>% 
  align_nottext_col(align = "center")  
```

3. Casual riders demonstrate a higher ride count on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) compared to weekdays, peaking on Saturdays (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataAnalysis1)C and table\ \@ref(tab:summaryTable2)).

```{r summaryTable2, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.width = 16, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%"}
filtered_data_2 %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = length(ride_id), 
            avg_ride_duration = mean(trip_duration_difftime), 
            percentage = number_of_rides/nrow(filtered_data_2) * 100, 
            member_pct = (sum(member_casual == "member") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            casual_pct = (sum(member_casual == "casual") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            member_casual_pct_diff = member_pct - casual_pct) %>% 
  arrange(match(weekday, c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", 
                         "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  flextable::set_caption("Summary data for day of the week (weekday).") %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) %>%
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align_text_col(align = "center") %>% 
  align_nottext_col(align = "center")  

```

4. Trends for both member and casual riders remain consistent throughout any given day of the month (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataAnalysis1)D and table\ \@ref(tab:summaryTable3)).

```{r summaryTable3, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.width = 16, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%"}
filtered_data_2 %>% 
  group_by(day_of_month) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = length(ride_id), 
            avg_ride_duration = mean(trip_duration_difftime), 
            percentage = number_of_rides/nrow(filtered_data_2) * 100, 
            member_pct = (sum(member_casual == "member") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            casual_pct = (sum(member_casual == "casual") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            member_casual_pct_diff = member_pct - casual_pct) %>% 
  arrange(desc(day_of_month)) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  flextable::set_caption("Summary data for day of the month (day_of_month).") %>%
  colformat_double(digits = 2) %>%
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align_text_col(align = "center") %>% 
  align_nottext_col(align = "center")  
```

5. Similarly, trends remain similar throughout the year for both types of riders (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataAnalysis1)E and table\ \@ref(tab:summaryTable4)). Both types of users tend to use bike for commute or leisure more during warmer months as compared to during winters. 

```{r summaryTable4, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.width = 16, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%"}
filtered_data_2 %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = length(ride_id), 
            avg_ride_duration = mean(trip_duration_difftime), 
            percentage = number_of_rides/nrow(filtered_data_2) * 100,

6. The dataset contains a greater number of members compared to casual riders (Figure\ \@ref(fig:dataCleanVerify1)F).

7. Despite being minimal, there is a notable positive correlation between membership type and weekday (0.06), and a negative correlation with the type of bike (_rideable_type_, -0.06). This suggests some nuanced differences between member types, warranting further investigation Figure (\@ref(fig:correlation1)).
8. The behavior of casual riders appears to be more spontaneous, evident from their off-peak usage of bikes and increased activity on weekends compared to regular members. This behavior could indicate that casual riders are tourists or individuals seeking leisure activities, utilizing bikes for exploration or enjoyment within the city.

# Additional Comments  

The dataset currently lacks information on potential customers who could potentially become either casual or regular members. Expanding the dataset to include such information would be beneficial. The marketing team could initiate brand awareness campaigns to expand the customer base. Given that there are already more regular members than casual riders, the company should aim to convert casual riders into regular members while also attracting new customers, both casual and regular. However, it's important to acknowledge that converting all casual riders into regular members may not always be feasible. Launching targeted campaigns during holidays, summer months, and in areas with high tourist traffic could help attract new customers. Offering special discounts aimed at non-users and casual riders would not only increase brand awareness but also expand the customer base.
